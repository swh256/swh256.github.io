Hi! I'm Weihong Sheng. My research interest is differential privacy (DP), including its theory and practice. I have completed several works on graphs for differentially private distance query with/without curator. I pursue rigorous DP theoretical guarantees and sophisticated real-world deployments, as well as other techniques that can assist DP to design more subtle systems or frameworks.
